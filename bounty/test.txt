need to work on the web based explotations to get more towards the Pentesting

Solving the CTF's need to be done and also the Bug bounty 

SOC analyst level 1 preparation is going on....

During the preparation for the cybersecurity the main challenges faced by me
-can't able to keep the linux commands noted (know what to use but the syntax is missing)
-no proper practice for what i have been preparing
-correct analysis of the given problem need to be done properly
-real life execution to be needed means we are going to work in larger organizations
