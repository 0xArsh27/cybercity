# Malware Sandbox – ANY.RUN

## Overview

ANY.RUN is an interactive online malware sandbox that enables analysts to execute and analyze suspicious files or URLs in a real-time Windows environment. Unlike automated sandboxes, ANY.RUN allows analysts to interact with the system during malware execution.

## Application in Malware Analysis

ANY.RUN is utilized to:
- Safely execute suspicious files and URLs
- Observe real-time malware behavior
- Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Analyze phishing payloads, droppers, and loaders
- Understand attacker techniques and infection chains

## Supported Analysis Types

- Executable files (.exe, .dll, .msi)
- Office documents with macros
- PDFs
- Archives (.zip, .rar)
- URLs (phishing or malware delivery pages)

## Key Features of ANY.RUN

### 1. Interactive Sandbox
Analysts can interact with the environment by clicking buttons, enabling macros, or entering fake credentials to trigger malware behavior requiring user action.

### 2. Real-Time Process Monitoring
Displays running processes, parent-child relationships, and suspicious process injections.

Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- Unexpected PowerShell or cmd execution

### 3. Network Activity Analysis
Captures DNS requests, HTTP/HTTPS traffic, and C2 connections.

Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- Connections to unknown or malicious domains/IPs

### 4. File System & Registry Changes
Tracks dropped files, persistence mechanisms, and registry modifications.

Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- Autorun registry keys
- Scheduled tasks

### 5. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
Automatically maps observed behavior to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, useful for reporting and threat classification.

## Workflow for Analysts

1. Upload the suspicious file or submit the URL.
2. Start sandbox execution.
3. Interact with the environment if required.
4. Observe:
   - Process tree
   - Network traffic
   - File and registry changes
5. Collect IOCs:
   - IPs
   - Domains
   - File hashes
6. Correlate findings with:
   - VirusTotal
   - Cisco Talos
   - SIEM alerts

## Indicators of Malicious Activity

- Suspicious child processes
- Obfuscated PowerShell commands
- C2 beaconing
- Credential harvesting behavior
- Persistence mechanisms

## Conclusion

ANY.RUN provides deep behavioral visibility into malware execution and is particularly effective for analyzing phishing-delivered malware that requires user interaction.

## Note

Use ANY.RUN after initial static analysis and avoid executing malware on production systems.
