# Hybrid Analysis – Automated Malware Sandbox

## Overview

Hybrid Analysis is a cloud-based, automated malware analysis platform that integrates static and dynamic analysis techniques to evaluate suspicious files and URLs. It is designed to rapidly classify malware and deliver detailed behavioral and technical insights without requiring analyst interaction during execution.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of Hybrid Analysis is to:
- Perform automated dynamic malware analysis
- Detect malicious behavior at scale
- Classify files and URLs as benign or malicious
- Support rapid triage in SOC operations
- Provide detailed reports for investigation and escalation

## Application

Hybrid Analysis is employed because it:
- Automates malware execution and analysis
- Delivers fast verdicts suitable for high-volume alert environments
- Combines static indicators with runtime behavior
- Integrates multiple detection engines and heuristics
- Reduces manual effort for routine malware analysis tasks

## When to Use Hybrid Analysis

Hybrid Analysis should be utilized when:
- Rapid classification of suspicious files or URLs is required
- Handling a large volume of samples in a SOC environment
- Malware is not suspected to require user interaction
- An initial behavioral overview is needed before deeper analysis
- Supporting evidence is required for incident reporting

## Supported Analysis Types

- Executable files (.exe, .dll, .msi)
- Office documents
- PDF files
- Scripts
- Archive files
- URLs

## Core Capabilities

### Automated Dynamic Analysis
Executes samples in a controlled virtual environment, observes behavior without analyst interaction, and detects runtime malicious activities.

### Static Analysis
Extracts file metadata, identifies embedded strings and resources, calculates file hashes, and flags known signatures.

### Behavioral Reporting
Displays process activity, network communication, file system changes, and registry modifications.

### Threat Scoring and Classification
Assigns risk scores and categorizes threats (e.g., malware, trojan, ransomware).

### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
Maps observed behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, aiding in standardized threat documentation.

## Workflow for Analysts

1. Upload the suspicious file or submit the URL.
2. Allow automated sandbox execution.
3. Review the analysis report and verdict.
4. Extract IOCs and behavioral indicators.
5. Correlate findings with other threat intelligence sources.
6. Escalate or remediate based on risk assessment.

## Analyst Output

- File hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
- Behavioral indicators
- Malicious IPs and domains
- Threat classification and score
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping

## Best Practices

- Use Hybrid Analysis for initial triage.
- Follow up with interactive sandboxes if required.
- Correlate results with VirusTotal and SIEM data.
- Avoid relying on a single sandbox verdict.

## Conclusion

Hybrid Analysis delivers fast, automated malware classification and behavioral insights, making it ideal for SOC environments requiring scalable and efficient malware triage prior to deeper investigation.
