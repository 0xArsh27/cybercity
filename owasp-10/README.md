# OWASP Top 10

## Overview

The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security professionals. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications globally. The OWASP Top 10 project is managed by the OWASP Foundation and is updated periodically to reflect the evolving threat landscape.

## What is OWASP?

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. Through community-led open source software projects, hundreds of local chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and leading educational and training conferences, the OWASP Foundation is the source for developers and technologists to secure the web.

- **Risk Awareness**: Identifies the most critical web application security risks
